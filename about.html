<p> Hi my name is Melissa and I am currently in my junior year at the University of Florida. I plan to graduate in Spring 2016 with a degree in Advertising. </p>

<p>I was born in San Jose, California but left the West Coast for good ol' Tampa, Florida when I was just a baby. I grew up there and haven't lived anywhere else! I think living in the same place for all my life has really contributed to my love of travelling. One of my favorite trips ever has been London, England. I'm looking forward to my study abroad trip this summer to Italy and I hope one day to travel to Thailand.</p>
