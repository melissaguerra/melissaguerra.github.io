            <p>Hi! My name is Melissa Guerra and I am currently in my junior year at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Fla. I am working towards a degree in Advertising with an outside concentration in Communications Studies. I am an active member of Delta Zeta sorority and a Community Events Captain for Dance Marathon at UF. I also work part-time at Pinner's Fine Shoes, a staple of the Gainesville community in its 46th year of retail, as a sales associate and social media manager.</p>
            <p>In my spare time, I love enjoying time with friends, spending days at the beach and running. I completed the Marine Corps Marathon alongside my dad in 2011 and plan to train for more races in the near future. I also love traveling and can't wait for my next adventure in Italy this summer! There are many places I have yet to go and can't wait to check them off my list. </P>
            <p> I appreciate you visiting my website. T
                o get in touch with me, please visit the contact page!</p>
