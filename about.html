            <p>Hi! My name is Melissa Guerra and I am currently in my junior year at the University of Florida in Gainesville, Fla. I am working towards a degree in Advertising with an outside concentration in Communications Studies. I am an active member of Delta Zeta Sorority and have held positions such as Public Relations Chair. I really enjoyed this position because I was responsible for all of Delta Zeta's social media platforms and for reporting our accomplishments to our national publication, The Lamp. </p>
            <p>I have also been involved with Dance Marathon at University of Florida, an organization that works year round to raise funds for Children's Miracle Network. Freshman year I was chosen as a dancer for Delta Zeta's team and stood for 26.2 hours all FTK (For The Kids). After expereiencing the event, I knew that I wanted to get involved with DM in any way I could. So sophomore year I interviewed and was selected as a Community Events Captain. The Community Events team is responsible for planning all the events leading up to Dance Marathon in the spring. I am now in my second year as a captain and could not be happier to be involved in such a wonderful organization. All funds raised are donated to UFHealth Shands Hospital right here in Gainesville. You can find out more information about Dance Marathon at UF right <a href="http://www.floridadm.org" target="_blank" title="DM"> here</a> and if you would like to donate, feel free to visit my <a href="http://floridadm.kintera.org/melissa_guerra" target="_blank" title="Dance Marathon"> personal donation page</a>. </p>
    <p>I also work part-time at Pinner's Fine Shoes as a sales associate and social media manager. Pinner's is certainly a staple of the Gainesville community and is currently in its 46th year of retail. Working at Pinner's has been such a great experience and one that has made my college career very unique. I have had the opportunity to meet so many great people and learn a lot. </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I love enjoying time with friends, spending days at the beach and running. I completed the Marine Corps Marathon alongside my dad in 2011 and plan to train for more races in the near future. To get back in the swing of things, I will be running the Gasparilla Half-Marathon in February in my hometown of Tampa, Florida. I also love traveling and can't wait for my next adventure in Italy this summer! There are many places I have yet to go and can't wait to check them off my list. </P>
